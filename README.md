Repository for my neovim and Tmux configuration .
The Tmux seems still unstable, I'll try to fix it.
NvChad can do more and is more stable than the vimscript version. Even though,
using the lua version with NvChad or the one writen in vimscript should offer
more or less the same experience. For the lua version, read the NvChad help.

# Installation
## Nerdfont
For both install, please install a nerdfont so it can work well:
https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts
Chose a nerdfont wihtout the "mono" keyword to get the best experience.

## General
Clone the git and copy the files in the right folders after installing neovim,
NvChad, tmux & tpm

# Lua/NvChad
The lua version is only the custom folder that is suppose to be added to the
NvChad configuration.
For NvChad follow : https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/

Missing :
        - Highlight the line where the cursor is.
        - Make sur it works on windows

# Vimscript
